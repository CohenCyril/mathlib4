# Modular character of a locally compact group

On a locally compact group, there is a natural character G → ℝ*, which for g : G gives the value
μ (· * g) / μ, where μ is an (inner regular) Haar measure. This file defines this character, called
the modular character, and shows that it is multiplicative and independent of the chosen Haar
measure.
TODO: Show that the character is continuous.

## Main Declarations

* `modularCharacter_fun`: Given a measure μ, define the modular character associated with this
measure, using the (noncomputable) `haarScalarFactor`. The result that this does not depend on the
measure chosen (as long as it is inner regular) is `modularCharacter_fun_eq`.
* `modularCharacter`: The homomorphism G →* ℝ≥0 whose toFun is `modularCharacter_fun`.
